This is a release of MySQL Connector/C++, Oracle's

MySQL FOSS License Exception
We want free and open source software applications under
certain licenses to be able to use the GPL-licensed MySQL
Connector/C++ (specified GPL-licensed MySQL client libraries)
despite the fact that not all such FOSS licenses are
compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License.
Therefore there are special exceptions to the terms and
conditions of the GPLv2 as applied to these client libraries,
which are identified and described in more detail in the
FOSS License Exception at
<http://www.mysql.com/about/legal/licensing/foss-exception.html>

This distribution may include materials developed by third
parties. For license and attribution notices for these
materials, please refer to the documentation that accompanies
this distribution (see the "Licenses for Third-Party Components"
appendix) or view the online documentation at
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/>.

GPLv2 Disclaimer
For the avoidance of doubt, except that if any license choice
other than GPL or LGPL is available it will apply instead,
Oracle elects to use only the General Public License version 2
(GPLv2) at this time for any software where a choice of GPL
license versions is made available with the language indicating
that GPLv2 or any later version may be used, or where a choice
of which version of the GPL is applied is otherwise unspecified.
