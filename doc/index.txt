MySQL Connector/C++ Documentation  {#mainpage}
=================================

MySQL Connector/C++ is a library for applications written in C or C++ that want
to communicate with MySQL database servers. Version 2.0 of Connector/C++
implements new APIs which, on top of traditional SQL, give access
to MySQL implementing a document store. For code written in C++ this is the new
[X DevAPI] (@ref devapi), which is the common MySQL API to access
MySQL Document Store, also implemented by other MySQL connectors. Code written
in plain C can use the [XAPI] (@ref xapi) -- a new plain C API which offers
functionality similar to X DevAPI.

More information:

- [Connector/C++ X DevAPI Reference] (@ref devapi_ref)
- [Connector/C++ XAPI Reference] (@ref xapi_ref)
- [How to build code that uses Connector/C++](@ref usage)
- [Building Connector/C++] (@ref building)

@note
Code that uses Connector/C++ 2.0 can communicate only with MySQL Server version
5.7 with X Plugin loaded into it.
