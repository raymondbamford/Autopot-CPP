 How to build code that uses Connector/C 7.0  {#build}
=======================

When compiling code which uses MySQL Connector/C, add
`<Connector/C install location>/include` to the include path of
the project, and link compiled code with
the `<Connector/C install location>/lib/libmysqlcconn-static.a` library.
On a Linux platform, also link with the `pthread` library on which
Connector/C depends on that platform.
Solaris clients also need to link libnsl library (-lnsl).

An example `Makefile` to build an application using Connector/C,
with sources in `app.cc` looks like this:

~~~~~~~
MYSQL_CONCC_DIR= <Connector/C install location>
CFLAGS = -I $(MYSQL_CONCC_DIR)/include
LDLIBS = -lpthread

app : app.o $(MYSQL_CONCC_DIR)/lib/libmysqlcconn-static.a
~~~~~~~

To use Connector/C 7.0 MYSQLX API the source code should include the `mysqlx.h` header.

Implementation Notes
-------------
The Connector/C driver is implemented as a static library:

libmysqlcconn-static.a in Linux/Unix systems

mysqlcconn-static.lib in Windows systems

@todo Implement Connector/C 7 as a shared library
