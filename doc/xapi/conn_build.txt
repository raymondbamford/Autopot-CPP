Building Connector/C 7.0  {#conn_build}
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------
To build Connector/C++, the following tools and libraries are required:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++03.

- CMake 2.8.11 or later.

- Boost library version 1.55 or higher. Tested with Boost 1.56.

Build configuration
-------------------

If `cmake` can not find correct Boost version, or if it is installed
in non-standard location, specify correct location using option:

- `-DWITH_BOOST=<Boost location>`

To specify installation location (see below), use option:

- `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<Install location>`

Building and testing
--------------------
A build can be started with the following cmake invocation in the build
location:

~~~~~~~
$ cmake --build . --config <`Release` or `Debug`>
~~~~~~~

Ommitting `--config ...` will result in building the default `Debug` configuration.

@note
  In what follows the same build configuration (`Release` or `Debug`) must be used
  for all the steps such as installing the connector or building
  the test program.

After a successful build, the build location shouild contain
the Connector/C 7 static library `libmysqlcconn-static.a`
(`mysqlcconn-static.lib` in Windows).
